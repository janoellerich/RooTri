# RooTri
With the function RooTri(), we present a simple and robust calculation method for the approximation of the intersection points of a scalar field given as an unstructured point cloud with a plane oriented arbitrarily in space in MATLAB. 

## Instructions
1. Add RooTri(arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5) to you current work folder
2. Pass input arguments
   - arg1   point cloud P as n x 3 matrix
   - arg2   a of of parameter plane equation, default = 0    
   - arg3   b of of parameter plane equation, default = 0  
   - arg4   c of of parameter plane equation, default = 1  
   - arg5   d of of parameter plane equation, default = 0
3. Execute script, output m x 2 matrix called 'ipmat'
